    "\n",
    "1. The original dataset is a collection publicly accessible customer reviews/complaints scraped from [Hellopeter](https://www.hellopeter.com/) site between 2021 and 2023. This dataset was [created](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/dsm050-2023-apr/blob/master/notebooks/01_hellopeter/01-01_retrieve_data.ipynb) in another research project investigating: [Evaluating Customer Satisfaction and Preferences in the Telecommunications Industry: A Comparative Analysis of Survey Data and Online Reviews](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/dsm050-2023-apr/blob/master/notebooks/04_draft/04-04_cw02.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data selection was perform in the `00-01_data_selection` notebook based on the following criteria.\n",
    "    - Reviews from the for the 5 month period from **2022-06-01** to **2023-06-30** were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Only reviews from the **Vodacom** telecommunications company were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Very short, or very long reviews were removed. Reviews between from **10** to **100** words were selected. The word count was calculated using a basic `.str.split().str.len()` which is sufficient for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The unlabeled data was then labeled in the `01-02_batch_classification` notebook using Generative AI.\n",
    "    - The **Mistral 7B v0.2** Large Language Model (LLM) were hosted on the local servier with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). Please refer to the `01-01_classification_test` notebook for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The classification was done using multiple prompts similar to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques for classification. _Implementation details can be found in the `src` directory._\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classification was done based on the categories defined in `src/config/category_definitions.jsonl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It took an average of **7 seconds** to classify a single review.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using Generative AI for labeling introduced new categories that were cleaned up in the `01-03_cleanup` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First new categories that were prefixed with an original category were replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Then, new categories that contained an original category in round brackets were replaced with the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For the remaining new categories, the reviews were manually inspected and the reviews were reclassified via manual mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The data labels was then converted into a format suitable for modeling in the `02-01_data_preperation` notebook."

    "## 3. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the metrics described in the paper titled \"CAVES: A Dataset to facilitate Explainable Classification and Summarization of Concerns towards COVID Vaccines\" (DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2204.13746), we have selected the following metrics to estimate the performance of models on our multi-label classification dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **F1-Score (Macro-average and Weighted-average)**: \n",
    "    - **Justification**: The F1-Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it a balanced measure that considers both false positives and false negatives. The macro-average F1-Score treats all classes equally, emphasizing the importance of performing well across all classes, including the less frequent ones. The weighted-average F1-Score accounts for class imbalance by weighting the F1-Score of each class by its support (the number of true instances for each label). This is crucial in multi-label classification tasks where some labels may be more prevalent than others.\n",
    "    - **Calculation & Meaning**: The macro-average F1-Score is calculated by taking the average of the F1-Scores of all classes, while the weighted-average is computed by weighting each class's F1-Score by the number of true instances for that class. These metrics evaluate the model's overall performance across all labels, with macro-averaging treating every class equally and weighted-averaging considering the class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Jaccard Similarity**:\n",
    "    - **Justification**: The Jaccard Similarity, or Intersection over Union, is particularly well-suited for multi-label classification. It measures the similarity between the set of predicted labels and the set of true labels by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the union of the predicted and true label sets. This metric is useful for evaluating performance in multi-label settings where the exact match might be too strict.\n",
    "    - **Calculation & Meaning**: The Jaccard Similarity is calculated for each instance and then averaged. A higher Jaccard score indicates a greater degree of overlap between the predicted and true labels, signifying better model performance in capturing the multilabel nature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subset Accuracy (Exact Match)**:\n",
    "    - **Justification**: Subset accuracy is the strictest metric, requiring the set of predicted labels to exactly match the set of true labels for an instance to be considered correct. This metric is important in scenarios where the goal is to precisely predict the full set of applicable labels.\n",
    "    - **Calculation & Meaning**: Subset accuracy is the proportion of instances for which the predicted label set exactly matches the true label set. It provides a clear indication of the model's ability to perfectly predict label sets, though it may be too stringent for some multi-label applications."

    "#### Evaluate the model\n",
    "\n",
    "From the evaluation results below we can see that wile the baseline model appears to perform well when considering the **Categorical accuracy** it performs poorly when considering the **F1-Score** and **Jaccard Similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to understand the **Binary Accuracy** metric as reported by Keras. This metric treats each label as a separate binary classification problem. It calculates the percentage of correctly predicted labels (both positive and negative) across all labels and instances. High binary accuracy indicates that, on average, the model is good at deciding whether a specific label should be applied or not, but it doesn't consider the exact set of labels for each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Diagnosing the Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Imbalance**: If some labels are much more frequent than others, the model might learn to predict these labels more accurately, contributing to high binary accuracy. However, rare labels might be poorly predicted, which affects F1 scores and Jaccard similarity negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Correlations**: In real-world data, labels can be correlated (e.g., \"Network Coverage\" and \"Service\" might often appear together). If the model fails to capture these correlations, it might still achieve good binary accuracy by getting many labels right based on their individual occurrences but fail at accurately capturing the relationships between labels, which is crucial for high F1 scores and Jaccard similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thresholding**: The way you convert model outputs (probabilities) into label predictions (binary) can significantly impact performance. The default threshold is 0.5, but adjusting this threshold might improve F1 scores and Jaccard similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Improving The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are potential strategies for improving the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Architecture**: Experiment with different model architectures, layers, and hyperparameters. Attention mechanisms or more sophisticated RNNs and CNNs might capture label correlations better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Weights**: Adjust class weights to handle imbalanced data better, making the model pay more attention to rare labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metric Optimization**: Instead of optimizing for binary accuracy during training, consider optimizing directly for metrics more aligned with your actual goals, like F1 score or Jaccard index, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Threshold Tuning**: Experiment with different thresholds for converting probabilities to binary labels, or consider using ranking-based metrics if thresholding proves problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❗️As discussed in a previous section, the dataset is imbalanced at both the label and label combination levels. This imbalance is likely contributing to the discrepancy between the binary accuracy and the F1 scores and Jaccard similarity."
