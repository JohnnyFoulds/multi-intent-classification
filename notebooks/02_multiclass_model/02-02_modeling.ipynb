    "\n",
    "1. The original dataset is a collection publicly accessible customer reviews/complaints scraped from [Hellopeter](https://www.hellopeter.com/) site between 2021 and 2023. This dataset was [created](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/dsm050-2023-apr/blob/master/notebooks/01_hellopeter/01-01_retrieve_data.ipynb) in another research project investigating: [Evaluating Customer Satisfaction and Preferences in the Telecommunications Industry: A Comparative Analysis of Survey Data and Online Reviews](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/dsm050-2023-apr/blob/master/notebooks/04_draft/04-04_cw02.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data selection was perform in the `00-01_data_selection` notebook based on the following criteria.\n",
    "    - Reviews from the for the 5 month period from **2022-06-01** to **2023-06-30** were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Only reviews from the **Vodacom** telecommunications company were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Very short, or very long reviews were removed. Reviews between from **10** to **100** words were selected. The word count was calculated using a basic `.str.split().str.len()` which is sufficient for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The unlabeled data was then labeled in the `01-02_batch_classification` notebook using Generative AI.\n",
    "    - The **Mistral 7B v0.2** Large Language Model (LLM) were hosted on the local servier with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). Please refer to the `01-01_classification_test` notebook for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The classification was done using multiple prompts similar to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques for classification. _Implementation details can be found in the `src` directory._\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classification was done based on the categories defined in `src/config/category_definitions.jsonl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It took an average of **7 seconds** to classify a single review.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using Generative AI for labeling introduced new categories that were cleaned up in the `01-03_cleanup` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First new categories that were prefixed with an original category were replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Then, new categories that contained an original category in round brackets were replaced with the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For the remaining new categories, the reviews were manually inspected and the reviews were reclassified via manual mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The data labels was then converted into a format suitable for modeling in the `02-01_data_preperation` notebook."

    "For a multi-label text classification task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a commonsense baseline could be designed using simple heuristics based on the frequency of specific keywords or phrases associated with each label. Multi-label classification differs from binary or multi-class classification in that each text instance can be associated with multiple labels simultaneously, rather than belonging to just one category.\n",

    "To accomplish this we could start with  simple libraries like the [Natural Laugage Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) to tokenize the text and count the frequency of specific words or phrases associated with each label. We could then use these frequencies to predict the labels for new text instances. However for the sake of simplicity we will instead start with a very basic deep learning model."
