       "      <td>Out of bundle services stopped working after I did my simswap meaning airtime was being used for internet services after loading airtime. I only found this out because my airtime was just vanishing without me using it. I just called the call centre and they confirmed that it was the out of bundle setting that is causing this. I then point out that even though I did a SimSwap I am still using the same number I had set the out of bundle setting to stop using my airtime for internet services so I do not understand how a simswap affects settings in place on a long existing number. I did not change numbers, I changed simcards and the out of bundle setting is done on the NUMBER not the simcard so it makes no sense to me how a simswap affects the settings in place on my number. To be clear, I called vodacom many moons ago and told them, please stop using my airtime for data services and they stopped it, things were fine for many years until the current simswap was done. My argument here is why should a simswap matter cause the setting is done on the number and not on the simcard. So it makes no sense that a simswap resets everything. Even if it does the history on my number shows what settings are in place linked to my number. I would like my airtime used for data services replenished since I did my simswap. I have wifi at home and there is no reason why my airtime would be used for data services.\\n\\nFurthermore what led to me doing a simswap is that my number simply stopped working, I could not make or receive calls. The last time this happened I had received a call from a person claiming to be from VODACOM. The person told me that someone did a simswap on my number and I need to switch off my phone for 2 hours in order for them to block the simswap from happening. In turned out the person was not from vodacom and me switch off my phone for 2 hours is actually what made the Simswap happen. I queried this and I did not get meaningful information from Vodacom. I queried again today and the day I made the SimSwap and nobody can explain to me what keeps happening to my number. I need an explanation as to why my number would just randomly stop working.\\n\\nMy simcard has not been taken out of my phone this whole year so there is not damage that happened to it as it was tucked into the simcard slot the whole time. I very frustrated because clearly there is ******** activities happening on my number and it's leaving a bad taste in my mouth cause vodacom has no answers. I also tried to speak to your support on twitter and they too could not help. It's like nobody has any knowledge of anything.</td>\n",

       "0  Out of bundle services stopped working after I did my simswap meaning airtime was being used for internet services after loading airtime. I only found this out because my airtime was just vanishing without me using it. I just called the call centre and they confirmed that it was the out of bundle setting that is causing this. I then point out that even though I did a SimSwap I am still using the same number I had set the out of bundle setting to stop using my airtime for internet services so I do not understand how a simswap affects settings in place on a long existing number. I did not change numbers, I changed simcards and the out of bundle setting is done on the NUMBER not the simcard so it makes no sense to me how a simswap affects the settings in place on my number. To be clear, I called vodacom many moons ago and told them, please stop using my airtime for data services and they stopped it, things were fine for many years until the current simswap was done. My argument here is why should a simswap matter cause the setting is done on the number and not on the simcard. So it makes no sense that a simswap resets everything. Even if it does the history on my number shows what settings are in place linked to my number. I would like my airtime used for data services replenished since I did my simswap. I have wifi at home and there is no reason why my airtime would be used for data services.\\n\\nFurthermore what led to me doing a simswap is that my number simply stopped working, I could not make or receive calls. The last time this happened I had received a call from a person claiming to be from VODACOM. The person told me that someone did a simswap on my number and I need to switch off my phone for 2 hours in order for them to block the simswap from happening. In turned out the person was not from vodacom and me switch off my phone for 2 hours is actually what made the Simswap happen. I queried this and I did not get meaningful information from Vodacom. I queried again today and the day I made the SimSwap and nobody can explain to me what keeps happening to my number. I need an explanation as to why my number would just randomly stop working.\\n\\nMy simcard has not been taken out of my phone this whole year so there is not damage that happened to it as it was tucked into the simcard slot the whole time. I very frustrated because clearly there is ******** activities happening on my number and it's leaving a bad taste in my mouth cause vodacom has no answers. I also tried to speak to your support on twitter and they too could not help. It's like nobody has any knowledge of anything.   \n",

I have 4 contracts with them.  I have been trying to upgrade my phone without any success.  time and money wasted every minute trying to sort this out!!\\n\\nI got married in 2020,  i changed my surname at the Vodacom shop in Secunda.\\nin 2023 I had to upgrade my wifi which i did but for some reason I had to travel 50 km to Vodacom Woodlands in Pretoria because Anita phoned me and said I need to come in.  I then changed my surname with her.\\n\\nI have to upgrade an phone and first Anita gave me the incorrect information and promised a phone I cannot have.  my upgrade was done over the phone, but RAM refused to give the telephone to me as my surname is still not changed on the system.\\n\\ni changed my surname 2 x  in the last two week.  still not updated with Vodacom so i cannot have my phone.  In the meantime I have to sit with the inconvenience.\\nI gave RAM a copy of my marriage certificate as well as a certified copy of my original ID and it was not good enough.  \\n\\nI want to cancel everything with Vodacom but then I have to pay penalties!!!!  for a service I am not getting anyway!!!\\n\\nNobody can sort this out for me.  is this the way to treat a customer that has been with the company for such a long time???   \n",
